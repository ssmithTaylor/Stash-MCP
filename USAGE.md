# Stash-MCP Usage Guide

This guide covers common usage patterns and workflows for Stash-MCP.

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Stash-MCP is with Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dylanturn/Stash-MCP.git
cd Stash-MCP

# Start the server
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the server
docker-compose down
```

Your content will be stored in the `./content` directory on your host machine.

### Local Development

For development or if you prefer to run without Docker:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set content directory (optional, defaults to /data/content)
export STASH_CONTENT_DIR=./content

# Run the web server (includes REST API and UI)
python -m stash_mcp.web_server

# Or run the MCP server for stdio transport
python -m stash_mcp.server
```

## Using the Web Interface

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ui to access the web interface.

The UI allows you to:
- Browse all your content files
- View file contents
- Navigate through directories
- Search content (semantic search when enabled, filename filtering otherwise)

## Using the REST API

The REST API is available at http://localhost:8000

### API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Common API Operations

**List all content:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/content
```

**Read a specific file:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/content/docs/welcome.md
```

**Create or update a file:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/content/notes/my-note.md \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "# My Note\n\nContent here..."}'
```

**Delete a file:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/content/old-file.md
```

## Using the MCP Protocol

Connect your MCP client to Stash-MCP to allow AI agents to access and manage content.

### MCP Configuration

Stash-MCP runs as an HTTP server exposing a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp`. Connect MCP clients using one of the following methods.

**Option 1: Claude Desktop via `mcp-proxy` (Recommended for Desktop)**

`mcp-proxy` bridges Claude Desktop's stdio transport to Stash-MCP's Streamable HTTP endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-proxy",
        "--transport",
        "streamablehttp",
        "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `uvx` must be on the PATH that Claude Desktop sees. On macOS, GUI apps may not inherit your shell PATH — use the full path if needed (e.g. `/Users/you/.local/bin/uvx`).

Alternatively, use `npx mcp-remote` if you have Node.js but not uv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8000/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Native Streamable HTTP (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)**

Clients that support Streamable HTTP natively can connect directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code CLI:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http stash http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

**Option 3: Local stdio (no container)**

Run the server as a stdio subprocess directly from your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/Stash-MCP", "-m", "stash_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "STASH_CONTENT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/content"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting MCP Connections

**"Connection refused" errors**

Ensure the server is running and reachable:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```
If this fails, check that the Docker container is up (`docker-compose ps`) or the local server process is running.

**`uvx` / `npx` not found**

Claude Desktop may not inherit your shell's PATH. Use the full absolute path to the binary:
- Find it with `which uvx` or `which npx` in your terminal
- On macOS: typically `/Users/you/.local/bin/uvx` or `/usr/local/bin/npx`
- Update your MCP config to use the full path as the `command` value

**Tools not appearing in Claude**

After editing your MCP config, fully restart Claude Desktop (quit and reopen — not just reload). Check the MCP server logs:
- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-stash.log`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-stash.log`

**Timeout on first connection**

The search index build runs in the background at startup and can take a few seconds for large content directories. The MCP endpoint is available immediately, but `search_content` results may be empty until indexing completes. Check indexing status via:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/search/status
```

### MCP Resources

Resources represent files that can be read by agents:

- **URI format:** `stash://path/to/file.md`
- **List resources:** Use `resources/list` to see all available files
- **Read resource:** Use `resources/read` with a specific URI

### MCP Tools

Tools allow agents to create, edit, overwrite, move, and delete content. Modifications require the file's current SHA-256, returned by `read_content`:

**create_content** - Create a new file (errors if it already exists):
```json
{
  "path": "docs/new-doc.md",
  "content": "# New Document\n\nContent..."
}
```

**read_content** - Read a file and get its `sha` for later modifications:
```json
{
  "path": "docs/existing-doc.md"
}
```

**edit_content** - Apply targeted string-replacement edits to an existing file:
```json
{
  "file_path": "docs/existing-doc.md",
  "sha": "<sha from read_content>",
  "edits": [{"old_string": "old text", "new_string": "new text"}]
}
```

**overwrite_content** - Replace the full content of an existing file:
```json
{
  "path": "docs/existing-doc.md",
  "sha": "<sha from read_content>",
  "content": "# Updated content..."
}
```

**delete_content** - Delete a file:
```json
{
  "path": "docs/old-doc.md",
  "sha": "<sha from read_content>"
}
```

**search_content** *(available when search is enabled)* - Semantic search:
```json
{
  "query": "authentication flow",
  "max_results": 5,
  "file_types": ".md,.py"
}
```

## Semantic Search

Stash-MCP includes an optional semantic search feature that lets agents and users find content by meaning rather than exact keywords. Search is **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled.

### Enabling Search

#### With Docker Compose

Add the search environment variable to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  stash-mcp:
    build: .
    environment:
      - STASH_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
```

The default Docker image includes the `sentence-transformers` embedding provider. To use a different provider, override the build argument:

```bash
# OpenAI embeddings
docker build --build-arg SEARCH_EXTRA=search-openai -t stash-mcp .

# Cohere embeddings
docker build --build-arg SEARCH_EXTRA=search-cohere -t stash-mcp .

# Sentence-transformers + Anthropic contextual retrieval
docker build --build-arg SEARCH_EXTRA=search-contextual -t stash-mcp .
```

#### Local Development

Install the search dependencies for your preferred embedding provider:

```bash
# Sentence-transformers (local, no API key needed)
pip install -e ".[search]"

# OpenAI embeddings
pip install -e ".[search-openai]"

# Cohere embeddings
pip install -e ".[search-cohere]"

# Sentence-transformers + Anthropic contextual retrieval
pip install -e ".[search-contextual]"
```

Then enable search by setting the environment variable:

```bash
export STASH_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
```

### How Search Works

When search is enabled, the server:

1. **Indexes content at startup** — All files are chunked (using markdown-aware splitting) and embedded into vectors
2. **Keeps the index up-to-date** — File creates, updates, and deletes automatically update the search index
3. **Persists the index to disk** — The vector index is saved to `STASH_SEARCH_INDEX_DIR` and reloaded on restart
4. **Skips unchanged files** — Incremental indexing only re-embeds files whose content has changed
5. **Auto-reindexes on model change** — If `STASH_SEARCH_EMBEDDER_MODEL` changes between restarts, the stale index is automatically cleared and rebuilt with the new model
6. **Auto-reindexes on index schema change** — The server stamps an internal `INDEX_SCHEMA_VERSION` into the index. When an upgrade bumps it (because the per-chunk layout changed — e.g. the chunk `metadata` dict or `heading_path` was added), the whole index is cleared on the next startup and rebuilt, exactly like a model change. Two consequences to plan for: `search_content` returns **no results** until the rebuild finishes, and every chunk is re-embedded, which on a paid embedding provider is a real, one-off bill proportional to the size of your store. Upgrade during a quiet window, and watch for the `Search index schema version ... clearing index for rebuild` warning in the logs to know it happened
7. **Scoped search** — `search_content` and `GET /api/search` accept `path_prefix` (hard scope: one or more subtrees; anything outside them is hidden from results) and `boost_prefix` (soft scope: boosts a subtree's ranking without hiding anything outside it), plus `exclude_patterns` (globs), `include_excluded`, and metadata filters (`metadata_filters={"layer": "x"}` / `?filter=layer:x`). Results report the heading path a snippet came from, when the source has one. Document metadata comes from YAML frontmatter (any top-level scalar key) or, leniently, from `Key: value` fields in the blockquote directly under the H1; it is returned on every result, on `read_content`/`inspect_content_structure`, and can be changed with `update_metadata`. `list_content` accepts `max_depth`, `glob`, `limit` and `with_metadata` for large stores

### Using Search via MCP

When search is enabled, a `search_content` tool is registered in the MCP server:

```python
# Search for content by meaning
result = await client.call_tool("search_content", {
    "query": "authentication flow",
    "max_results": 5,
    "file_types": ".md,.py"  # optional: filter by extension
})
```

### Using Search via REST API

Three search endpoints are available when search is enabled:

```bash
# Semantic search
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/search?q=authentication+flow&max_results=5"

# Check search engine status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/search/status

# Trigger a full reindex
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search/reindex
```

### Using Search in the Web UI

When search is enabled, the sidebar search box uses vector-based semantic search with debounced queries. Results link directly to the matching files. When search is disabled, the sidebar provides client-side filename filtering instead.

### Contextual Retrieval

For higher quality search results, enable contextual retrieval. This uses Claude to generate a short contextual preamble for each chunk before embedding, improving retrieval accuracy:

```bash
export STASH_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
export STASH_CONTEXTUAL_RETRIEVAL=true
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

> **Note:** Contextual retrieval requires the `search-contextual` dependency group and an Anthropic API key. It increases indexing time and cost but improves search relevance.

## Git tracking

Stash-MCP can track every write in a local git repository, giving you file history, diffs, and blame alongside the content itself. Git tracking is **disabled by default**; set `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true` to enable it — the content directory must already be a git repository (contain a `.git` folder). This adds `log_content`, `diff_content`, and `blame_content` MCP tools, and enriches search results with commit metadata.

### Autocommit vs. transactions

With `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true` every write runs under one short write lock. Set `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=true` to commit each write immediately — every write tool and REST endpoint accepts an optional `commit_message` and `author`, so `git log`/`blame_content` show which agent wrote what (the web UI's editor commits automatically instead, tagged `UI: save/move/delete <path>`). To land several writes as one commit, open a transaction first (`start_content_transaction` … `commit_content_transaction`); transactions are per-session, may be open concurrently, and commit/abort only the files they touched. With autocommit off (default) *MCP* writes outside a transaction are rejected, as before — but the REST API and the web UI are never transaction-gated: they take the write lock and commit each write immediately whatever `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT` is set to.

## Content Organization

Organize your content in a way that makes sense for your use case:

```
content/
├── docs/           # Documentation
├── notes/          # Personal notes
├── specs/          # Technical specifications
├── reference/      # Reference materials
└── examples/       # Example content
```

The directory structure maps directly to MCP resource URIs, so:
- `content/docs/api.md` → `stash://docs/api.md`
- `content/notes/2024-01-15.md` → `stash://notes/2024-01-15.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

Check that the port isn't already in use:
```bash
lsof -i :8000
```

### Content not showing up

Verify the content directory is correctly mounted/configured:
```bash
echo $STASH_CONTENT_DIR
ls -la $STASH_CONTENT_DIR
```

### Permission errors

Ensure the server has read/write permissions to the content directory:
```bash
chmod -R 755 content/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version control:** Consider putting your content directory under git version control
2. **Backups:** Regularly backup your content directory
3. **Organization:** Use a consistent directory structure and naming convention
4. **Documentation:** Keep a README in your content directory explaining your organization system
5. **Security:** Run Stash-MCP on localhost or behind authentication if exposing to a network
