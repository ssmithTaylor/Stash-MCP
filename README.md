## Features

- **Centralized knowledge store** — One place to stash documentation, notes, specs, and reference material that any connected agent can access
- **File-first design** — Files on disk are the source of truth. No database layer. Inspect, edit, or manage content directly on the filesystem
- **MCP native** — Content is exposed as MCP resources (read path) and MCP tools (write path), so agents can both consume and update documentation
- **Rich rendering** — Markdown with Mermaid diagrams, syntax-highlighted code, and a built-in OpenAPI viewer for `.json` specs
- **Semantic search** *(opt-in)* — Vector-based search across all stashed content; local embeddings run on ONNX Runtime (no PyTorch/CUDA in the image), with pluggable remote providers
- **Git tracking** *(opt-in)* — File history, diffs, and blame are exposed as MCP tools; writes are gated behind atomic, git-committed transactions by default
- **Read-only mode** — Serve reference docs to agents without allowing any modifications
- **Simple deployment** — Single Docker container with a volume mount. No external dependencies

## The UI

Stash-MCP ships with a browser UI so humans can curate the same content their agents are reading. It uses the same filesystem as the MCP server — anything an agent writes shows up immediately, and anything you write is available to the agent on the next read.

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop Extension (one-click install)

The fastest way to use Stash-MCP with Claude Desktop is the `.mcpb` Desktop Extension:

1. Download `stash-mcp.mcpb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/dylanturn/Stash-MCP/releases/latest)
2. Double-click the file — Claude Desktop opens the installer
3. Set your **Content Directory** (the folder where your documents live)
4. Optionally enable **Git Tracking** or **Semantic Search**
5. Click **Install** — the Stash icon appears alongside tool calls in Claude

> **Requirements:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) must be installed and on your PATH.

### Docker Compose (recommended for servers)

```bash
docker-compose up -d        # start
docker-compose logs -f      # tail logs
docker-compose down         # stop
```

Endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost:8000/ui` | Web UI |
| `http://localhost:8000/mcp` | MCP (Streamable HTTP) |
| `http://localhost:8000/api/...` | REST API |
| `http://localhost:8000/api/health` | Health check |

Your content is persisted in `./content`.

### Local development

```bash
uv sync                       # install deps
uv run -m stash_mcp.main      # run the server
uv run pytest                 # run tests
uv run ruff check .           # lint
```

## Connecting MCP clients

Once the server is running, connect Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or any other MCP client using one of the methods below.

**Claude Desktop via `mcp-proxy`** — bridges Desktop's stdio transport to Stash-MCP's Streamable HTTP endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-proxy", "--transport", "streamablehttp", "http://localhost:8000/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `uvx` must be on the PATH that Claude Desktop sees. On macOS, GUI apps may not inherit your shell PATH — use the full path if needed (e.g. `/Users/you/.local/bin/uvx`).

`npx mcp-remote` works as an alternative if you have Node.js but not uv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8000/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Native Streamable HTTP** (Claude Code, Cursor, anything that supports HTTP MCP natively):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": { "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Or from the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http stash http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

**Local stdio (no container)** — run the server as a stdio subprocess directly from your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stash": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/Stash-MCP", "-m", "stash_mcp.server"],
      "env": { "STASH_CONTENT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/content" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### MCP resources (read)

Every file in the content directory is exposed as an MCP resource under the `stash://` scheme:

```python
resources = await client.list_resources()
content   = await client.read_resource("stash://docs/architecture.md")
```

### MCP tools (write)

Agents create, edit, move, and delete content through MCP tools. Modifications are guarded by an optimistic-concurrency check: `read_content` returns the file's SHA-256, which `edit_content`, `overwrite_content`, and `delete_content` require:

```python
await client.call_tool("create_content", {
    "path": "docs/new-doc.md",
    "content": "# New Document\n\nContent here..."
})

result = await client.call_tool("read_content", {"path": "docs/existing-doc.md"})

await client.call_tool("edit_content", {
    "file_path": "docs/existing-doc.md",
    "sha": result.data["sha"],
    "edits": [{"old_string": "old text", "new_string": "new text"}]
})

await client.call_tool("delete_content", {
    "path": "docs/old-doc.md",
    "sha": "<sha from read_content>"
})
```

With git tracking enabled, three additional read tools are exposed: `log_content`, `diff_content`, and `blame_content`. See [Git Tracking](#git-tracking).

### REST API

The same content is accessible over HTTP:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/content                          # list
curl http://localhost:8000/api/content/docs/architecture.md     # read
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/content/docs/new.md \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "# New Doc"}'                              # write
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/content/docs/old.md    # delete
```

### Web UI

Open `http://localhost:8000/ui` to browse the content tree, view rendered Markdown and OpenAPI specs, edit documents, and search content (semantic search when enabled, filename filtering otherwise). See [The UI](#the-ui) for screenshots.

## Configuration

Core environment variables:

- `STASH_CONTENT_ROOT` — Content directory path (default: `/data/content`)
- `STASH_HOST` — Server host (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- `STASH_PORT` — Server port (default: `8000`)
- `STASH_LOG_LEVEL` — Logging level (default: `info`)

The rest of this section covers optional modes — read-only, git tracking, sync, transactions, search, and metrics — and the full env var reference.

### Read-only mode

Set `STASH_READ_ONLY=true` to disable all write tools. The server then only exposes read resources and tools — agents can read and search content but cannot create, update, delete, or move files, and transaction tools are not registered.

Use read-only mode when serving reference documentation to agents without allowing modifications, or when exposing content from a shared volume that other processes own.

```yaml
environment:
  - STASH_READ_ONLY=true
```

### Git tracking

Set `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true` to enable git-aware features.

**Auto-init when no remote is configured.** If the content directory is not yet a git repository, Stash-MCP initialises one automatically on startup and makes an initial commit — including any files already present in the directory (respecting `.gitignore`), so nothing pre-existing is left untracked. This only happens when no remote is configured: a `STASH_GIT_SYNC_URL` (or legacy `STASH_GIT_CLONE_URL`) always takes precedence and clones instead — see [Git sync](#git-sync). If the content directory turns out to sit *inside* an existing git repository (for example, a parent directory was already initialised), the server refuses to start rather than create a nested repo — this check runs regardless of whether the content directory itself exists yet, so it also catches the common case where an *ancestor* of a not-yet-created content directory is the pre-existing repo. Point `STASH_CONTENT_ROOT` at the parent repo's root, run `git init` in the content directory yourself first if a nested repo is genuinely intended, or set `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=false`.

What it enables:

- Three additional MCP tools: `log_content`, `diff_content`, and `blame_content`
- Search results enriched with `last_changed_at`, `changed_by`, and `commit_message`
- Writes (when `STASH_READ_ONLY=false`) are automatically committed to the local git repo — gated behind transactions by default, or immediately per-write when `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=true` (see [Transactions](#transactions))

```yaml
environment:
  - STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true
```

### Git sync

Set `STASH_GIT_SYNC_ENABLED=true` to have the server periodically pull from a remote git repository. Requires `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true`.

The server pulls from `STASH_GIT_SYNC_REMOTE`/`STASH_GIT_SYNC_BRANCH` every `STASH_GIT_SYNC_INTERVAL` seconds.

**Authentication.** Provide `STASH_GIT_SYNC_TOKEN` for HTTPS token authentication. The token is injected via a local git credential helper at `.git/stash-credential-helper.sh` — no manual credential configuration is required.

**Auto-clone on startup.** Set `STASH_GIT_SYNC_URL` to the HTTPS URL of the repository. When the content directory is empty, the server clones from that URL using `STASH_GIT_SYNC_BRANCH` and `STASH_GIT_SYNC_TOKEN`, then configures the remote as `STASH_GIT_SYNC_REMOTE`. `STASH_GIT_TRACKING` is auto-enabled after a successful clone, so you don't need to set it explicitly. This always takes precedence over the local auto-init described in [Git tracking](#git-tracking) above, and a failed clone is always a hard startup failure — it never falls back to initialising an empty local repo, which would silently mask a real misconfiguration (bad URL, expired token, wrong branch) behind what looks like a working but empty store.

```yaml
environment:
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_ENABLED=true
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_URL=https://github.com/org/content-repo.git
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_BRANCH=main
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

If the content directory already contains a git repository, the clone is skipped and sync proceeds as normal (the remote must already be configured):

```yaml
environment:
  - STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_ENABLED=true
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_REMOTE=origin
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_BRANCH=main
  - STASH_GIT_SYNC_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

### Transactions

When `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true` and `STASH_READ_ONLY=false`, writes are gated behind transactions by default: an agent must open one before it can write, and a batch of related changes lands in git as a single, path-scoped commit. Set `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=true` to commit every write immediately instead and make transactions optional. The gate applies to MCP writes only: REST (`/api/content/...`) and web-UI writes take the write lock but are never transaction-gated, so they commit immediately regardless of `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT`.

Workflow:

1. Call `start_content_transaction` — returns a transaction ID immediately; it never waits on the write lock
2. Perform any number of write calls (`create_content`, `overwrite_content`, `edit_content`, `edit_content_batch`, `delete_content`, `move_content`, `move_content_directory`, `move_content_batch`) — each write lands on disk right away and is recorded as part of the transaction; committing to git is deferred to step 3
3. Call `commit_content_transaction` with a commit message — stages and commits only the files this transaction touched, then releases the write lock
4. If something goes wrong, call `abort_content_transaction` — restores only the files this transaction touched to their last-committed state, then releases the write lock

**Concurrency.** Transactions are per-session and non-exclusive: each MCP session may have at most one open transaction, but any number of sessions may each hold one at the same time — one session's open transaction never blocks another session from opening its own or from writing. The write lock is short: it's held only for the duration of a single write or a single commit/abort, never for a transaction's whole lifetime, and `start_content_transaction` never waits on it. A write only queues for the lock (up to `STASH_TRANSACTION_LOCK_WAIT` seconds, then fails with "server busy") if another write or commit/abort is in progress at that exact instant. If a transaction sits idle for `STASH_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT` seconds — no writes, no commit, no abort — it is automatically aborted.

### Mode matrix

| `STASH_READ_ONLY` | `STASH_GIT_TRACKING` | `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT` | `STASH_GIT_SYNC_ENABLED` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `false` | `false` | — | — | Default: writes go directly to disk, no git |
| `true`  | `false` | — | — | Read-only: no write tools registered |
| `false` | `true`  | `false` | `false` | MCP writes gated behind transactions; REST/UI writes commit immediately |
| `false` | `true`  | `true`  | `false` | Every write commits immediately; transactions optional, for grouping |
| `true`  | `true`  | — | `false` | Read-only + git history/blame tools available |
| `false` | `true`  | either | `true`  | As the matching row above, plus periodic pulls from the remote and a push whenever the branch is ahead |
| `true`  | `true`  | — | `true`  | Read-only + git history/blame + auto-sync from remote |

`STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=true` without `STASH_GIT_TRACKING=true` is ignored with a warning; it never fails startup.

```

### Search configuration

Semantic search is **disabled by default**. To enable:

- `STASH_SEARCH_ENABLED` — Enable semantic search (default: `false`)
- `STASH_SEARCH_INDEX_DIR` — Directory for search index persistence (default: `/data/.stash-index`)
- `STASH_SEARCH_EMBEDDER_MODEL` — Embedder model string (default: `onnx:BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`), see below
- `STASH_MODEL_CACHE_DIR` — Where locally downloaded model weights are cached (default: `/data/models`; mount a volume there so the download happens once)
- `STASH_SEARCH_ONNX_THREADS` — onnxruntime thread count for the `onnx:` backend (default: onnxruntime's, one per host core; set e.g. `2` under container CPU limits)
- `STASH_SEARCH_HYBRID_ENABLED` — Fuse BM25 keyword matching with vector search (default: on when `bm25s` is installed — the `search`, `search-contextual` and `search-hybrid` extras include it; the API-provider and torch extras do not)
- `STASH_SEARCH_HEADING_CONTEXT` — Also fold each chunk's `path > heading > subheading` breadcrumb into the embedded text (default: `true`; set `false` for collections under roughly a hundred documents — see [Breadcrumbs](#breadcrumbs))
- `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_ENABLED` — Rescore the top results with a cross-encoder (default: `false`, see [Reranking](#reranking))
- `STASH_CONTEXTUAL_RETRIEVAL` — Enable Claude-powered contextual chunk enrichment (default: `false`)
- `STASH_CONTEXTUAL_MODEL` — Model for contextual retrieval (default: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Required when contextual retrieval is enabled

**Embedding backends.** The model string's prefix selects the backend:

| Prefix | Backend | Install extra | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `onnx:` | Local, ONNX Runtime via [fastembed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) — no PyTorch, no CUDA libraries (**default**) | `search` | `onnx:BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim, 512-token window, ~66 MB — the default), `onnx:BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768-dim, higher quality, ~210 MB), `onnx:sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (fp32, 384-dim, 256-token window, ~90 MB). Any model in `fastembed.TextEmbedding.list_supported_models()` works. |
| `openai:` | OpenAI embeddings API via Pydantic AI | `search-openai` | `openai:text-embedding-3-small` |
| `cohere:` | Cohere embeddings API via Pydantic AI | `search-cohere` | `cohere:embed-english-v3.0` |
| `sentence-transformers:` | Local, PyTorch via sentence-transformers (opt-in; ~5 GB of torch + CUDA wheels) | `search-torch` | `sentence-transformers:all-mpnet-base-v2` |

Model files are downloaded from Hugging Face on first use into `STASH_MODEL_CACHE_DIR/fastembed`. Models that need instruction prefixes (`intfloat/*e5*`, `nomic-*`, `snowflake-arctic-*`, `mixedbread-*`, `BAAI/bge-*-en` v1) get them automatically; override with `STASH_SEARCH_QUERY_PREFIX` / `STASH_SEARCH_DOCUMENT_PREFIX`.

> The default model's published MTEB retrieval score (51.7, against ~42 for `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) is measured on the full-precision weights; fastembed ships a half-precision ONNX export, which reproduced the PyTorch vectors to within 8e-4 cosine in a side-by-side check here.

**How retrieval works.** Any chunk that would overflow the embedding model's token window is split rather than silently truncated, and each chunk records a `path > heading > subheading` breadcrumb that comes back with the result. Queries run against both the vector index and a BM25 keyword index; the two rankings are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, diversified with MMR, and optionally rescored by a cross-encoder.

Measured against three corpora — a large public documentation tree, a standard IR benchmark with human relevance judgments, and a small private stash:

| corpus | metric | previous defaults | current defaults |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes docs — 1,097 documents, 54 queries | MRR | 0.380 | **0.592** |
| BEIR SciFact — 5,183 documents, 300 human-judged queries | nDCG@10 | 0.625 | **0.703** |
| Small documentation stash — 52 documents, 42 queries | MRR | 0.740 | **0.810** |

Most of the gain is lexical. Hybrid BM25 fusion is the single largest contributor everywhere — on the Kubernetes corpus it accounts for essentially all of it (+0.152 of +0.156, taking literal-identifier queries from 0.567 to 0.790) — and it only started working at all once a bug that discarded the fused ranking was fixed. The lexical index also covers each chunk's breadcrumb, making headings and file paths keyword-searchable: +0.040 MRR on its own, at no runtime cost. Finally, the 512-token window stops chunks being silently truncated — 82% of default 1000-character chunks exceeded the old model's 256-token limit — which also cuts the index 42% because the splitter no longer has to fragment every document.

Two caveats worth knowing. The embedding model change is the weakest-supported part: it wins clearly on SciFact (+0.040 dense-to-dense) but is roughly neutral on the Kubernetes corpus and *loses* on prose-only subsets there and on a deliberately code-heavy corpus (this repository: 0.938 for the old configuration against 0.875). If your content is mostly source code, `STASH_SEARCH_EMBEDDER_MODEL=onnx:sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` may serve you better. And the small-stash row above would read 0.865 rather than 0.810 with `STASH_SEARCH_HEADING_CONTEXT=false` — see [Breadcrumbs](#breadcrumbs).

#### Breadcrumbs

Every chunk records where it came from — `path > heading > subheading`. That breadcrumb is always returned with the result, and always indexed by BM25 so a document can be found by its own name. Whether it *also* joins the embedded text is `STASH_SEARCH_HEADING_CONTEXT`, and the right answer depends on how many documents you have:

| corpus | documents | breadcrumb embedded |
|---|---|---|
| this repository's source | 14 | negative |
| a small documentation stash | 52 | −0.055 MRR |
| Kubernetes documentation | 1,097 | **+0.056 MRR** |

With few documents a chunk's own wording nearly identifies its source already, so the breadcrumb's extra tokens only dilute the vector. With many — especially when some are near-identical generated reference pages — knowing the section and path is what tells them apart. It is **on by default** for the larger case; **set it to `false` if your stash is under roughly a hundred documents**, where the free lexical copy is not just sufficient but strictly better.

#### Reranking

A cross-encoder reads the query and the chunk together instead of comparing two independently-made vectors, which reorders the shortlist more accurately. It is **off by default**: on the corpus above it is worth +0.017 MRR (0.865 → 0.882) but takes a query from ~4 ms to ~220 ms on CPU and adds a ~120 MB download. It is strongest on prose questions (0.856 → 0.895) and slightly *negative* on exact-identifier queries (1.000 → 0.958), which the lexical index already answers perfectly. Sensible for agent traffic, where 200 ms disappears next to an LLM turn; less so behind the Web UI's live search.

Model choice matters more than model size:

| `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_MODEL` | Download | Overall MRR |
|---|---|---|
| *(reranking off)* | — | 0.865 |
| **`Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`** (default) | ~120 MB | **0.882** |
| `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | ~80 MB | 0.863 |
| `jinaai/jina-reranker-v1-tiny-en` | ~130 MB | 0.824 |
| `jinaai/jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en` | ~150 MB | 0.816 |

Both jina rerankers scored *worse than not reranking at all* despite being larger than the L-6 model, so pick by measurement rather than by parameter count.

How many candidates to rescore is the latency dial, and more is not better:

| `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_CANDIDATES` | Overall MRR | ms/query |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 0.865 | 105 |
| **10** (default) | **0.882** | 222 |
| 20 | 0.880 | 480 |

Shortening the text sent to the cross-encoder is not a useful economy — truncating chunks to 500 characters cut latency to 200 ms but dropped MRR to 0.845, worse than reranking half as many full chunks.

Reranking also runs **only on contested result sets**. When the two best retrieval scores are further apart than `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_MARGIN` (default `0.1`), retrieval already has a clear winner and the cross-encoder is skipped. On the benchmark that skipped 29% of queries and cut mean latency from 218 ms to 160 ms with identical ranking quality; a wider margin reranks more often (0.3 → 12% skipped, 194 ms), and `0` reranks unconditionally.

> Both benchmarks are small (42 and 24 queries), hand-labelled, and run on one corpus each — one query moves overall MRR by ~0.02–0.04. Treat them as direction, not precision, and prefer measuring on your own content.

- `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_MODEL` — cross-encoder to use (default: `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`)
- `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_CANDIDATES` — how many results to rescore (default: `10`; ~22 ms each)
- `STASH_SEARCH_RERANK_MARGIN` — only rerank when the two best scores are this close (default: `0.1`; `0` reranks every query)

> With reranking on, the `score` field returned by `/api/search` and `search_content` is the cross-encoder's logit — unbounded, sometimes negative, and only comparable within a single result set — rather than a 0–1 cosine similarity.

When search is enabled, the server exposes:

- An MCP `search_content` tool for agents
- REST endpoints at `/api/search`, `/api/search/status`, and `/api/search/reindex`
- Vector-based search in the Web UI sidebar

The index records a fingerprint of everything that determines its vectors — the embedder model, chunk size and overlap, the heading-breadcrumb setting, contextual retrieval and any document prefix. Change one of those and the stale index is cleared and rebuilt automatically on the next start; retrieval-only settings (MMR, recency, hybrid, reranking) never force a rebuild.

**Upgrading an existing deployment triggers one full re-index**, even if you pin the previous model: this release changes the text that gets embedded (heading breadcrumbs, context-window splitting), and an index written before those existed carries no fingerprint to prove otherwise. The first start after the upgrade also builds the BM25 index for hybrid retrieval. Both happen in the background — the server answers immediately, and `GET /api/search/status` reports progress. To keep the previous model, set `STASH_SEARCH_EMBEDDER_MODEL=onnx:sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`; for the PyTorch backend, build with `--build-arg SEARCH_EXTRA=search-torch` and use `sentence-transformers:all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

> **CPU requirement:** numpy ≥ 2.4 wheels (a dependency of every search extra; `uv.lock` pins 2.4.x) are built for the x86-64-v2 baseline (SSE4.2/POPCNT) and fail with `Illegal instruction` on older or generic virtual CPUs. On Proxmox/QEMU VMs with the `kvm64` CPU type, search cannot start regardless of backend — set the VM CPU type to `host` (or `x86-64-v2-AES`) or leave `STASH_SEARCH_ENABLED=false`.

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for detailed search setup instructions.

### Local metrics

Stash-MCP collects **local, opt-out** usage metrics — nothing is sent externally. Metrics are stored in a [TinyFlux](https://github.com/citrusvanilla/tinyflux) time-series CSV file on disk and give operators visibility into tool call rates, response times, error rates, HTTP request patterns, content growth, and search performance.

Metrics are **enabled by default**. To disable:

```yaml
environment:
  - STASH_METRICS_ENABLED=false
```

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `STASH_METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable all metrics collection |
| `STASH_METRICS_PATH` | `{STASH_CONTENT_ROOT}/../metrics.csv` | Path to the TinyFlux CSV database file |
| `STASH_METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | Auto-prune data points older than this many days (`0` = keep forever) |

What is collected:

- **Tool calls** — tool name, duration (ms), success/failure, error type, transport (stdio/http)
- **HTTP requests** — method, endpoint path, status code class (2xx/4xx/5xx), duration (ms)
- **Content events** — create/update/delete/move events with file extension and size
- **Search queries** — provider, hashed query, result count, duration (ms)
- **Server lifecycle** — startup and shutdown events

| `STASH_GIT_AUTHOR_DEFAULT` | `stash-mcp <stash@local>` | Fallback committer/author identity |
| `STASH_GIT_AUTOCOMMIT` | `false` | With git tracking: commit every write outside a transaction immediately (per-write `commit_message`/`author`); transactions become optional grouping. `false` keeps the transaction gate |
| `STASH_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds before an active transaction is auto-aborted |
| `STASH_TRANSACTION_LOCK_WAIT` | `120` | Seconds a write waits for the write lock before failing with "server busy" |

| `STASH_SEARCH_INDEX_DIR` | `/data/.stash-index` | Search index directory |
| `STASH_SEARCH_EMBEDDER_MODEL` | `onnx:BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` | Embedder model: `onnx:` (local, ONNX Runtime), `openai:`, `cohere:`, or `sentence-transformers:` (local, PyTorch; needs `search-torch`) |
| `STASH_SEARCH_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` | — | Comma-separated globs (same dialect as `STASH_CONTENT_PATHS`, root-anchored) hidden from search results unless `include_excluded=true`, e.g. `**/_reports/**,**/_archive/**` |
| `STASH_SEARCH_BOOST_WEIGHT` | `0.15` | Score bonus (×(1+weight)) for results under `boost_prefix` — soft scoping that prefers a root without hiding the rest |
| `STASH_MODEL_CACHE_DIR` | `/data/models` | Cache for locally downloaded model weights (`onnx:` models go in a `fastembed/` subdir) |
